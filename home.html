            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>In today's digital age, data communication is an essential part of our daily lives. From sending emails to browsing the internet, data is constantly being transmitted between devices and networks. But have you ever wondered how this happens? The OSI model is a fundamental concept in computer networking that explains how data is transmitted and received over a network. This page will provide an in-depth look at the OSI model, its seven layers, and some of the most common data communications protocols used today.</p>

            <h2>What is the OSI Model?</h2>
            <p>The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand how data is transmitted over a network. It is divided into seven layers, each with its own specific functions. Understanding the OSI model is crucial for anyone who works with computer networks, as it provides a common language and framework for describing network communication.</p>
